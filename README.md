remember crazy images rendered with deep learning algorithms, copying style of old masters?

well, I wanted to do something similar, but with music. I used spectrograms as an input and trained model on music 
extracted from spotify. however, it is bugged and I think I might have screwed something up with spectrograms.

Expect this to change
